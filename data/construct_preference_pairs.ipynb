Among women who experienced IPV, nearly 4 in 10 (38.9%) were threatened with a gun by their partner in the 12 months before the survey. \n",
      "\n",

      "Psychological Impact of Guns in Domestic Violence\n",
      "\n",
      "For a victim of domestic violence, the presence of a gun can exacerbate the abuse they experience. Guns can be used as a way to control and intimidate their partners. Victims may be forced to witness their abuser using a gun, which can make it difficult for them to leave an abusive relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "• A study examining the link between intimate partner violence and firearm homicide found that exposure to firearm violence during childhood increases a woman’s risk of perpetrating IPV in adulthood.\n",
